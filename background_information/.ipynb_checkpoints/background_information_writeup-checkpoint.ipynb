    "Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding campaign platform for creative project makers seeking pledger support to pursue projects for categories like film, music, books, technology, and design. With\ta\tmission\tto help\tbring\tcreative projects\tto\tlife,\tKickstarter has\tattracted\tover\t13\tmillion dollars from backers\tto\tsuccessfully\tfund\t134,\t767\tprojects. Many recognizable products and companies that we know today began as Kickstarter projects; the most famous of which includes Occulus, a virtual reality company acquired by Facebook in 2014 for  2 Billion dollars (after raising $2.4 million on Kickstarter). Unlike other crowdfunding campaigns like gofundme.com, Kickstarter is unique because if the fundraising goal for a campaign is not met, then all pledged donations to the campaign will be returned to the donors. Kickstarter differentiates itself from other crowdfunding sites in this regard because it doesn't allow projects that fundraise for charity. Rather, projects must create something to share with others. While nonprofits can launch projects, the project can’t merely promise to raise funds to donate. Furthermore differentiating Kickstarter from other crowdfunding platforms is how Kickstarter has stricter regulations about what its platform can and can not be used for. While gofundme.com will let people raise funds for almost anything, Kickstarter has stricter regulations about what constitutes an allowed project; for example, projects can not fundraise for charity, nor can they involve prohibited items, offer equity to backers, or use photorealistic renderings of prototypes. \n",

    "If the creators do reach their goal amount, then and only then, will Kickstarter take 5 percent of the funds raised which gets used to support necessary operations for sustaining the platform. \n",

    "Kickstarter campaigns involve primarily two parties: the creators, and the backers. The creators are the party who is seeking financial support in order to execute their specified goal. This goal may be anything from a creative endeavor like a documentary film, to a business endeavor like a technology start up. The ability to provide a service that captures the needs and excitement of backers is key to the creators ability to gain backer support. Successful campaigns are thought to have both large numbers of pledgers and large pledge amounts. The creators are responsible for declaring a set goal amount that is needed in order to fund their ideas. Unless the creators are able to raise their goal amount within their specified time frame, Kickstarter returns all the pledged money to the campaign’s backers. In exchange for backer pledges, the Kickstarter campaign creators may choose to repay backers with interest on their pledge, or free products, but they may not repay their backers with equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backers are individuals who pledge donation amounts to campaigns in order to help the projects reach fruition.  In return for their pledges, backers receive reward promises that are determined by the terms of the Kickstarter campaigns’s creators. Kickstarter is inherently risky because crowdfunding sites can not promise that the projects funded will come to fruition. The backers may have someone take their money without any guarantee that they will get their money back. Similarly, creators may ultimately realize that they need more money than they initially projected so despite receiving the funds that they asked for, they will not be able to meet the promises they made for refunding their backers. \n",

    "Our data set is compiled from Kaggle, and it contains Kickstarter projects since its founding in 2009. In our data set, each observational unit is a Kickstarter campaign project. Each Kickstarter project has 15 variables associated with it. Each project has a unique ID, which is its internal Kickstarter ID, and a name which is the name of the project that the campaign creators have made. This project name is a title that creators are advised to make such that it contains a clear goal for what the projects intends to do and/or provide. There are 15 levels to the Main Category variable which is a large umbrella broad category that a project belongs to like Publishing, Food, Art, and Fashion. Category is a more narrow variable with 159 levels which describes the niche category that a project belongs to like Comic Books, Art Books, and Drinks. Currency is the currency used to support the project. Since projects are supported in various currencies, all pledged donations are converted to USD currency for comparison purposes. Deadline is the date that the campaign ends on. It is by this date that aggregate pledges must meet or exceed a projects set goal amount in order for the project to be a 'success'; otherwise, the project is a 'failure' all pledges are returned to donors and the creators do not get any of the pledged funds. If the project is terminated before it reaches its deadline date, then the project's status is defined as 'canceled'. Each campaign’s Goal is the fundraising goal reflecting the amount of money that a creator has determined that they need to complete their project. This is the amount of money that a project must obtain by the deadline in order to be successful. Launched is another variable the date that the creator’s launched the Kickstarter campaign on the platform. Pledged is the amount pledged by the ‘crowd’, and state is the current condition the project is in. If the pledged value for a project meets or exceeds the projects goal amount, then the project is a success. If the pledged amount is less than the goal amount, then the project has failed. In addition to failed and successful, there are also possible states like canceled, undefined, live, and suspended. Live conveys that the project is currently still in progress, and suspended projects which get canceled by Kickstarter for fraudulent or otherwise unacceptable behavior. Each observation also has a backers feature which records the number of backers that a project has. This is the number of unique pledges that a campaign receives. Country is the country in which the campaign is created in. We expect that the country that a project is created in should align with the currency that the campaign's pledges are in. We found an exception to this where 9 percent of pledges are in Great Britain Pound currency, yet only 8 percent of pledges are from Great Britain country. This is because there are countries outside of the United Kingdom that use the Pound. USD pledged is the amount of money pledged in US dollars, goal amount USD is the project’s goal amount converted to USD. Goal is in the currency in which the projects received pledges in, e.g.: a project in Great Britains actual goal amount would be in Great Britain's currency, however, USD Goal real is the projects goal amount converted into USD currency. We expect that for campaigns in the US that goal amount and USD goal real amounts are the same. However, for countries that use currencies other than USD, we expect that its goal amount and its USD goal real amount are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "USD pledged is different than USD pledged real because of how the conversions were calculated. USD pledged is the US dollar conversion amount of the pledged column as converted by Kickstarter. USD pledged real is the conversion in US dollars of the pledged column as converted with Fixer.io API. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these variables, we also derived our own for exploratory and modeling purposes. One of the variables that we created was Season denoting the season (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer). We expected that campains would be more successful in Winter due to the giving and philanthropic holiday season. We also derived time of day from the initial launch variable in order to see how the timing of a campaign's launch influenced its success. This variable had levels of mid-day, evening, late night, and morning. We suspected that campaigns launched on Kickstarter in the Morning would have more success because they would be checked by more people who check the site in throughout the day. From the launch variable and the deadline variable, we derived a campaign length variable that conveys how long the campaign is. Kickstarter's maximum length limit is 60 days, however Kickstarter advises creators to limit their campaign length to 30 days. For modeling purposes, we derived a year of launch variable from launch date to see if the year of a project's launch can be indicitaive of the projects success, maybe due to lurking economic conditions in each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We derived an hour of day variable from the launch feature which describes the hour in which the campaign was launched. Also for modeling purposes, we created boolean variables for whether or not the project name contains an exclamation point, and whether or not the project name contained title capitalization. We expect that projects with exclamation points would be more successful due to the jarring psychological influence of exclamation points, and the prevalence of exclamation points in spam to get viewer attention. Lastly, we created a word count variable for the number of words in the project name, and a length of characters variable counting the number of characters in project names. Certainly there is additional information about Kickstarter campaigns that we would like to have access to, however we could not consider due to limitations in our dataset. For example, we were curious to see if including a video on a campaign page influences the success rate of the project, but we did not have access to this such information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to extensive previous research that has been done investigating Kickstarter's relationship with startup culture, we expected technology as a category to be an important feature of successful campaigns, but this, as we'll show, was not the case. This such previous research has confirmed that Kickstarter is used both for one time projects like art installations, and also for ongoing projects like fashion and innovative gadgets. Among all the projects on Kickstarter, more than two-thirds fall into the one-time activities category. These projects enjoy a higher rate of success compared to ongoing ventures. However, they account for a much smaller share of total funding pledged on the platform. On average, ongoing ventures raised nearly twice as much as one-time activities. We were curious about hte implications of Kickstarter data to explai economic conditions in various countries, and according to  a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program analysis, Kickstarter funding is strongly related to venture capital investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kickstarter's website boasts a 36.59 percent success rate of its projects, with a third of its total backers being repeat backers. In our modeling analysis, we hope to use a Random Forest model to predict whether or not a Kickstarter project will be succesfull given only the information that creators would know at the time of launching (eg: not including the number of backers, and the amount of money pledged).  \n"
