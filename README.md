This is a group data analysis and visualizatoin project for Statistics 131 at UCLA.

### data
- a folder with the two kickstarter csv's

### background_info
- a folder to document background information, common knowledge, and discussion of variables
- discussion of each of the variables included in the dataset, and what the observational
unit is
- discussion of how the data is collected
- “Common knowledge” shared among relevant parties involved
- a review of other related research or studies that have been done

### exploratory analysis
- a folder for code exploring the data 
- any data cleaning and new derived features
- summary statistics
- outliers
- interesting relationships
- readable tables, graphs, and explanatory commentary

### data modeling
- a folder for code fitting a statistical model to data for prediction
- explain decisions regarding the choice of model, and the reasoning behind the inclusion of predictive features. (Probably backed up by the findings in the exploratory data analysis.)
- seperate training and testing data to fit a model for predictive purposes
- cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting features unique to the training data. A metric will need to be selected to show the predictive performance of the model.
