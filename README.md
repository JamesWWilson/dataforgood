This is a group data analysis and visualization project for Statistics 131 at UCLA.

To view the plots created for the exploratory analysis notebooks, copy and paste the notebook's github link into http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

### data
a folder with the two kickstarter csv's

### background_info
a folder to document background information, common knowledge, and discussion of variables
- discussion of each of the variables included in the dataset, and what the observational unit is
- discussion of how the data is collected
- “Common knowledge” shared among relevant parties involved
- a review of other related research or studies that have been done

### exploratory_analysis
a folder for code exploring the data  (view in http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ )
- any data cleaning and new derived features
- summary statistics
- outliers
- interesting relationships
- readable tables, graphs, and explanatory commentary

### modeling
a folder for code fitting a statistical model to data for prediction
- explain decisions regarding the choice of model, and the reasoning behind the inclusion of predictive features. (Probably backed up by the findings in the exploratory data analysis.)
- seperate training and testing data to fit a model for predictive purposes
- cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting features unique to the training data. A metric will need to be selected to show the predictive performance of the model.
